Welcome to my new blog powered by Jekyll! This is my first post.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for creating blogs. It transforms your plain text into static websites and blogs.

## Key Features

- **Simple**: No database, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install
- **Static**: Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Blog-aware**: Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts

## Getting Started

You can edit this post by modifying the file in the `_posts` directory. To add new posts, simply create new files in the `_posts` directory with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
