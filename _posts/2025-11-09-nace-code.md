A NACE code is a standardized classification system used in the European Union to categorize 
economic activities. The acronym NACE stands for the French term "Nomenclature statistique des 
Activités économiques dans la Communauté Européenne", which translates to Statistical Classification 
of Economic Activities in the European Community.

It is used for statistical reporting, economic analysis, business registration, eligibility for grants 
and funding as well as market research and KPI generation and comparison. 

NACE codes have 4 levels
1. Section: Represented by a single letter (A to U) indicating broad economic sectors.
2. Division: Represented by two digits (01 to 99) providing more specific categories within each section.
3. Group: Represented by three digits (e.g., 01.1 to 99.0) offering further detail within each division.
4. Class: Represented by four digits (e.g., 01.11 to 99.00) providing the most specific classification of economic activities.

The official Eurostat website provides comprehensive information on NACE codes which are downloadable
