SIRET identifiers are 14-digit codes that identify a specific establishment (site/branch) of a legal entity in France.

* SIREN: national identifier for a legal unit (the company/organization). 9 digits. Validation: SIREN: simple numeric identifier (no Luhn). Use to identify or join at the company/legal-entity level.
* SIRET: identifier for a specific establishment/site of that legal unit. 14 digits (SIREN + NIC) = SIREN (9 digits) + NIC (5 digits). NIC = 4-digit establishment sequence + 1 check digit. 
  Validation: full 14-digit value can be validated with the Luhn algorithm. Used when you need establishment-level detail (address, site-specific records, payroll, VAT/transactional records).

1. Structure: SIRET = SIREN (9 digits) + NIC (5 digits) — NIC = Numéro Interne de Classement (4-digit sequential establishment number + 1 check digit). The full SIRET can be validated with the Luhn algorithm.
2. Purpose: identifies individual physical locations for invoicing, filings, procurement, statistics and administrative records.
3. Relationship: SIREN identifies the legal unit (company/organisation); a single SIREN may have multiple SIRETs (one per establishment).
4. Source & lifecycle: assigned and published by INSEE in the SIRENE register; SIRET values change as establishments open/close, while the SIREN remains with the legal entity.
   Example: 73282932000074 (where 732829320 = SIREN, 00074 = NIC).
