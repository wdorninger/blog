# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  This is my personal blog—a curated collection of thoughts, ideas, scripts, and other useful resources.
  My financial services interests involve reference data, financial instrument modelling, legal entities
  and market data (level 1 and 2) in general. My IT interests primarily are focused on databases (of all kinds)
  Java and frameworks (Spring, Hibernate, Spark, Apache Airflow,...), Kubernetes, Cloud platforms etc.
